# Job-Portal-Smart-Contract
Job Portal Smari Contract/Solidity/Etherum Blockchain/Truffle/Ganache Network

Skills used in the project and their usage in the industry are given below:
1. Solidity – It is an object-oriented programming language that can be used to create smart contracts on a variety of blockchain systems.
2. VS Code – Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. 
3. Ganache  - It is a tool for creating a private Ethereum blockchain on which Solidity contracts can be tested. 
4. Truffle - Truffle is a world-class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

Develop a Dapp using Blockchain technology that connects unskilled and unorganized migrant workers with job providers. It can eliminate their exploitation by middlemen, such as unrecognized agents and contractors. A worker can register with the portal by creating their profile and uploading labor history, skills, availability, and other personal details. Then, a job provider can directly connect with the worker.
